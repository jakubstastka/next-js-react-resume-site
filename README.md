# My Simple Next.JS portfolio

I am using Next.JS to create my web portfolio. My current site is a Django app that is overkill for my needs and I really want to learn more of Typescript, React and Next.JS. This is still a WIP.

## Why?

I thought I needed backend for my Resume site, but I really don't. There were some ideas about me blogging and hosting in within the same Django project, but I found out I don't have that much to blog about. So using Next.JS for SSG to create a simple static resume site seems like a way to go.

## Next steps

As this is still WIP, I want to fully work with Typescript (currently not using it that much, all components are in .jsx so I can use snippets), add Projects, Experience and such.
